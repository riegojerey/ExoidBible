### Configuration of x86-64 Hardware

To boot Home Assistant OS, the BIOS needs to have UEFI boot mode enabled and Secure Boot disabled. The following screenshots are from a 7th generation Intel NUC system. The BIOS menu will likely look different on your system. However, the options should still be present and named similarly.

1. To enter the BIOS, start up your x86-64 hardware and repeatedly press the `F2` key (on some systems this might be `Del`, `F1` or `F10`).
2. Make sure the UEFI Boot mode is enabled.
3. Disable Secure Boot.
4. Save your changes and exit.

The BIOS configuration is now complete.
